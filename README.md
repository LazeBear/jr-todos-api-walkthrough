# jr-todos-api-walkthrough

The purpose of this project is to gain some practical experience on how to build an basic API server with Express.js, by achieving the following tasks:

- build up a basic express server with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods
- utilise middleware
- structure the project, so it's more maintainable and clean

_There is no database in this project, memory used to mimic the data storage_
